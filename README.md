# NLP
A very basic NLP project, inspired by Twitter Hate Speech Detection Project. 
The project uses TextBlob to label, process and then plot a bar graph of top adjectives used in Positive, Negative sentences. 
Since all of this is done with no labelled data at all, the results can be called at 50%. 
This should improve if an algorithm is trained on a dataset.
